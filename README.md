## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shearwork.git
cd shearwork
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

Make sure you have **Node.js (v18+)** installed, then run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Set up environment variables

Duplicate the example file and fill in your Supabase credentials. Or the current project lead will provide you with the .env:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add the following values (you’ll need access from the Supabase project owner):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

If you don’t have these keys yet, please contact the project owner or request access to the **Supabase team** via:
- Email: [austinkbartolome@gmail.com] or [trackingvalid@gmail.com]  
- or open a permissions request in the Supabase project dashboard.

> 🛡️ **Note:** Never commit `.env.local` to the repository — it contains sensitive keys.

---

### 4️⃣ Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running at  
👉 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

🗒️ **Notes:**
- `.env.local` should **never** be committed — it holds Supabase keys and secrets.  
- The `supabase/` folder may include SQL migrations or config for local database syncing.  
- The `lib/` folder is typically where your Supabase client instance (`supabaseClient.ts`) lives.  
- `proxy.ts` might handle routing or server-side fetch logic, depending on your setup.  
- When collaborating, developers should only need to install dependencies and get access to `.env.local`.

## 🧠 Supabase Setup

If you are setting up Supabase locally or need to connect your own instance:

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)  
2. Create a new project  
3. Copy your **Project URL** and **Anon Key** into `.env.local`  
4. Run migrations if applicable (`supabase db push` or use the SQL editor)

To gain access to the production database or analytics, request team access from the Supabase project admin.

---

## 🔄 Deployment

ShearWork is deployed via **Vercel**.  
When pushing to the `main` branch, Vercel automatically builds and deploys the latest version.

To deploy manually:

```bash
vercel
```

You’ll be prompted to link your project. Make sure to add the same environment variables on Vercel’s dashboard under:  
**Project Settings → Environment Variables**

## 🧑‍💼 Team Access & Permissions

If you’re joining the ShearWork developer team:

- Request access to the **Supabase project**  
- Request access to **Vercel deployment** if you’ll handle deployment or environment setup  
- Coordinate feature branches via GitHub Issues or Discussions  
- All environment variables and private credentials are managed by the project owner — never share them publicly

## 🌍 Example `.env.example`

Include this file at the root of your project as a template for environment setup:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Optional API Keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development
```

Developers should copy this template to create their local `.env.local` file before running the app.
